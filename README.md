# Component Design
In this homework, you will write an initial draft of the design of components in your project. This is a group homework.

The component design document should have the following sections:
- Component list. You will list the components of the design, justifying their inclusion by how they are needed for the use cases in your functional design document.
- Component specifications. For each component, you should have a section that species:
  - What it does. This should be a high level description of the roles of the component.
  - Name. This should be the name that you use in the component's implementation (e.g., the name of a function).
  - Inputs. Be specific about the data types. For DataFrames, be specific about the column names and the types of the column values.
  - Outputs. Same consideration as with inputs.
  - How it works (ideally with pseudo code).

At this point in your project, you should have at least 4 components. You should update your design document on an on-going basis as you add and change the components and their interactions.

Grading Rubic: One point for the component list section and one point for each of four component specification sections.
